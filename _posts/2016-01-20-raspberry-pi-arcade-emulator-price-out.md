##Update #1:

Today is the day I finally ordered my raspberry pi 3 model b, powersupply, and a 32GB SD card. I had an ich to get a bigger card, but then I came across [this](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/faqs/#sdMax) which led me to believe a 32GB card might be it's max and I don't want to pay more money only to find out it doesn't work.

###List Of Items Purchased:

$36.00 - [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-RASP-PI-3-Model-Motherboard/dp/B01CD5VC92/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1469844583&sr=8-3&keywords=raspberry+pi+3+Model+B)

$15.10 - [SanDisk Extreme 32GB microSDHC](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDHC-Adapter-SDSQXNE-032G-GN6MA/dp/B013CP5HCK?ie=UTF8&tag=codihorr-20)

$9.99 - [CanaKit 5V 2.5A Raspberry Pi 3 Power Supply](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Supply-Adapter-Charger/dp/B00MARDJZ4)

These three items tallied up to an exact: $61.09(including sales tax)

I'll have to get a case at another point and time. The one's on amazon wern't very appealing.

##Original Article:

Last week, while I was on vacation, I got inspired by my Uncle to build an arcade emulator. Then, coming back to work I found a hacker news post about an [article from coding horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-raspberry-pi-has-revolutionized-emulation/) detailing some of the specifics about raspberry pi based emulators. I figure the first step to see if I want to take on this project is to price out all of the hardware. Then depending on how much disposable income I can afford, I'll hopefully act upon this impulse thought.

Enjoy! :)
