        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the showcase of my creative pursuits! This is a collection of my attempts to bring various ideas to life. While many of these are solo adventures, occasionally I find a collaborator who is just as enthusiastic about plunging into a wild concept.</p>
<h3>Current:</h3>
<p>TBD</p>
<h3>Graveyard:</h3>
<p>Spare Cloud(<a href="https://sparecloud.io">https://sparecloud.io</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>A cloud storage backup service.</li>

<ul>
<li>A widget you can copy &amp; paste the code of into your website that helps you gather feedback from your customers.</li>
<li>Initial version had only five smiley faces. A more approachable version of an NPS tool.</li>
<li>Someone reached out to buy it from me before I got my first customer. I denied their offer.</li>
<li>Shutdown after spending another wasted year of my life on it only for the passion to dwindle.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>My Disney Plan</p>

</ul>
