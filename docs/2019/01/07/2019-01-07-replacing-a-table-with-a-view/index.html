        <h1>Replace a Table With View</h1>
        <p><i>Posted on 2019-01-07</i></p>
        <p>This weekend while on dev support, an issue came to our attention that
customers were still able to see <code>soft deleted</code> data in some parts of the app.
Instead of going through all the code and updating each query to return only
existing data though, I went directly to the source and replaced the table with
a view.</p>
<h4>Pros/Cons:</h4>
<p>Pros:
 - Easily revertible change.
 - Apply once, fixes all current queries.
 - Views can still have INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements run against them.
 - Good practice from a database design standpoint.</p>
<p>Cons:
 - Someone has to have access to the prod db to do it.
 - Can confuse other developers who are not familiar with views.
 - Depend on the indexes of the table below. You can not put an index on a view.</p>
<h4>This is how I did it:</h4>
<p>1) Rename the table.</p>
<p><code>SQL
RENAME TABLE chapters TO chapters_all;</code></p>
<p>2) Create a simple view that filters out deleted data.</p>
<p><code>SQL
CREATE VIEW `chapters` AS
    SELECT
        `chapters_all`.`id` AS `id`,
        `chapters_all`.`school` AS `school`,
        `chapters_all`.`removed` AS `removed`,
        etc...
    FROM
        `chapters_all`
    WHERE
        (`chapters_all`.`removed` = 0)</code></p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
