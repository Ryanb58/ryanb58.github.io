        <h1>The Case for Ambient Voice</h1>
        <div class="post-body">
            <p>It’s funny how small things can make such a big difference.</p>
<p>Discord, for instance, nailed it with passive voice chats.</p>
<p>Not just a tweak, but something that changes the way people work together.</p>
<p>It’s not a new feature, but they’ve managed to perfect the idea, turning voice channels into open rooms—always on, always available, but without any obligation to speak.</p>
<p>It’s surprising that Microsoft Teams hasn’t caught on to this yet. You’d think a sharp product manager would have jumped at the chance to add a similar feature, especially with all the talk about improving remote collaboration. But, here we are, still waiting.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I came up with a stopgap solution for my own team. Every Tuesday and Thursday, I schedule a recurring calendar event called “Team Voice Chat.” It’s just a simple placeholder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">Event Name: Team Voice Chat
Show As: Free
Require Responses: No
</code></pre>
<p>I add the team as optional attendees. The idea is that it’s there if you want it, and you’re free to drop in or out as needed. It worked well during a recent hackathon, and now we’re testing it over a longer stretch.</p>
<p>And it’s paying off. The benefits are exactly what you’d expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaboration gets a boost because you’re not scheduling every conversation.</li>
<li>Team bonding happens naturally in those small, unplanned moments.</li>
<li>Productivity goes up, because feedback is immediate.</li>
<li>It’s flexible, convenient, and doesn’t break your flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>So while we wait for Teams to catch up, this little hack has made our days a bit more frictionless. Simple, but effective—like most good ideas.</p>
