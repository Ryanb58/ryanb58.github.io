<h3>False Beliefs I Once Held:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You should have everything figured out.</li>
<li>Success follows a linear path.</li>
<li>You'll stop making mistakes.</li>
<li>Money solves all problems.</li>
<li>Confidence comes from having all the answers.</li>
<li>"Fake it till you make it" is a reliable strategy.</li>
<li>Saying No is bad and can close doors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Life Lessons I Learned Along the Way:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Big software rewrites are usually a waste of energy, time, and money.</li>
<li>Solving business problems should take priority over pursuing technical perfection.</li>
<li>Being nice costs nothing and often pays off in unexpected ways.</li>
<li>Helping others achieve their goals is as rewarding as fulfilling your own.</li>
<li>Rules are often created without foresight; following them blindly is a mistake.</li>
<li>Software isn't always the solution, but it can be a powerful tool.</li>
<li>Ideas are plentiful; the ones who execute them are rare.</li>
<li>Perfection is the enemy of progress.</li>
<li>IMHO quality beats quantity.</li>
<li>Learn to say Yes to opportunities that push you out of your comfort zone.</li>
<li>Traveling the world isnt as scary as it seems  its incredibly fun.</li>
<li>Enjoy the Journey because the destination isn't always that interesting.</li>
<li>Take care of your teeth.</li>
<li>Spend time thinking about your career, not just what you need to accomplish today.</li>
<li>Life style changes are more important than diets when adjust ones body composition.</li>
<li>Best part(code) is no part(code).</li>
<li>Setting ambitious goals is a good idea.</li>
<li><a href="https://paulgraham.com/writing44.html">Write</a></li>
<li>Keep a second brain. Currently, I use obsidian to store notes and day to day journey activies.</li>
<li>Physical work is a great type of therapy.</li>
<li>Craft and tell good stories.</li>
<li>A rising tide lifts all boats.</li>
<li>Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.</li>
<li>Confidence - Is self-trust in your skills, choices, and values. An inner knowing of your strengths and weaknesses while intentionally thinking positively about oneself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Farewell to my twenties, and a warm welcome to my thirties!</p>
