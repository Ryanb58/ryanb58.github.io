        <h1>Revenue vs Profit</h1>
        <p><i>Posted on 2021-10-14</i></p>
        <p>Recently, I've noticed an uptick in the usage of the words <strong>Revenue</strong> and <strong>Profit</strong> in my vicinity. Whereas this isn't a bad thing, I think the meaning of each gets skewed in some conversations. Therefore, now seems like a good time to quickly review each of their definitions.</p>
<p>The word <strong>Revenue</strong> according to Merriam Webster's 2nd description is as follows. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the gross income returned by an investment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, if I sold 10 cattle for $500 each, that would leave me with a Revenue of $5000.</p>
<p>The word <strong>Profit</strong> according to Merriam Webster's 2nd description is as follows. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the excess of returns over expenditure in a transaction or series of transactions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we append to the previous example and say that each cow cost me $100 each. Then we would deduct that cost from the <strong>revenue</strong> and end up with the <strong>profit</strong>. Therefore, $5000 - $1000 = A profit of $4000.</p>
<p>For a more detailed analysis on these two words, I encourage you to take a look at <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122214/what-difference-between-revenue-and-profit.asp">Investopedia's article</a> comparing the two.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
