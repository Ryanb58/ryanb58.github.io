        <h1>Site Pixel</h1>
        <p><i>Posted on 2021-05-19</i></p>
        <p>For a few years now, I've wanted a tool that collects feedback from my users. I've thought about using existing products like Drift or Intercom, but they don't really match my use case. I want to understand what my users are thinking and feeling. Thus, I have been working on building out an web app called <a href="https://sitepixel.io">Site Pixel</a>.</p>
<p>The initial idea is simple.</p>
<p>A user navigates to a web app. Then, a widget pops up somewhere on the screen with a few emojis on it. Giving the opportunity for the user to click one that best represents how they feel. That data is then recorded for later review.</p>
<p>Using this data; marketers, stakeholders, and developers could correlate feature releases and redesigns with actual data provided by their customers. Giving them the opportunity to make more data backed decisions and prevent simple mistakes. While gaining an understanding of the overall sentiment around their site. I mean most people want to use things they love, right?</p>
<p>So far, I've been building this application and documenting my journey on <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/site-pixel">IndieHackers</a>. While I plan on continuing to post my standup content there, I'll put my bigger overarching content here on my newly redesigned personal site/blog.</p>
