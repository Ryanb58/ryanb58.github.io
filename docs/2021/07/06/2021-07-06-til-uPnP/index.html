        <h1>TIL About uPnP</h1>
        <p><i>Posted on 2021-07-06</i></p>
        <p>Today I learned about uPnP.</p>
<p>I came across a blog post by <a href="https://kn100.me/turning-upnp-off/">Kevin Norman</a> who talks about how his NAS punched its way through the local consumer router, exposing itself to the world. This sparked my attention, as how could it even do such a thing without human input? From what I remember with my time sitting in a networking class, you had to manually forward ports to allow a locally hosted website to be accessible from the public web. Ends up this isn't the case anymore with a technology called uPnP. </p>
<p>uPnP stands for Universal Plug and Play. It is a set of networking protocols built on top of TCP/IP stack. According to uPnP-hacks.com it was created back in the 1990s by Microsoft as a competing protocol to Sun's JINI. The main reason for it's development was to allow networking devices to attach themselves to networks in comparison to how a hot swappable hard drive can be added to your NAS box. </p>
<p>Some interesting use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discover an xBox on the network.</li>
<li>Allow your IP Webcam to be publicly accessible.</li>
<li>Retrieve music and video from a media server.</li>
<li>Allow smart home appliances to discover each other and share info.</li>
<li>Enable syncing of local IoT devices</li>
</ul>
<p>While going down this rabbit hole of discovery I came across one of my own favorite project uses uPnP for local discovery. WLED.</p>
