        <h1>Django Migrations Downgrade in Docker Swarm</h1>
        <p><i>Posted on 2018-03-02</i></p>
        <p>Edge cases are a big problem in software engineering, one that I recently ran<br />
into while on a beta box was errors being thrown after a downgrade.</p>
<p>First a little background on the application. It is a django application running<br />
in a docker container via docker-swarm. Our application upgrade/downgrade<br />
process is to reduce the amount of containers running down to 0. Change the<br />
tag numbers in our .yml file and then scale them back up. This forces the<br />
containers to download the newly defined version. Note that our downgrade<br />
process is exactly the same we just update the a tag with an older version.</p>
<p>The process described above might sound correct to you, however, because we use migrations<br />
to structure our database the process is flawed. By replaceing the tag and<br />
just moving to older docker containers, the downgrade function inside our<br />
migrations never get ran. Instead the downgraded application has no idea<br />
about the migrations that existed in the newer version that does not in it's<br />
own. Thus resulting in an inconsistant database state with the version of<br />
application deployed.</p>
<p>My current solution to this issue is to run the migration downgrade for each<br />
app in our django project manually inside of the existing application container<br />
. To do this I start out with a diff of the code between the old version and<br />
the new version. I look for any added migrations and run the command below to<br />
have django south run through the downgrade methods until it reaches the<br />
latest migration in the old code. Then I perform the old migration method.</p>
<p>Here is a step by step list of the process.</p>
<p>1) Diff of code.</p>
<p>2) Write down oldest added migration number and app name</p>
<p>3) Exec into the application docker container.</p>
<p>4) Migrate backwards :</p>
<pre><code>./manage.py migrate appname 0000
</code></pre>
<p>5) Exit out of container.</p>
<p>6) Scale the swarm down to 0 nodes.</p>
<p>7) Change tag number.</p>
<p>8) Scale the containers back up.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions or any improvements to this process? Comment below<br />
and link me to other articles you've read about this process. The more we know<br />
together the better our overall solutions can be.</p>
