            <h2>Quick Rant About Semantic Versioning</h2>
<p>There is inherent information loss when a developer implements Semantic Versioning.
Taken aback a little by that statement? Well, let's ask if it's true?</p>
<ul>
<li>When was the last time you could tell someone the difference between version 1.2.1 and 1.2.3 quickly?</li>
<li>Can you tell me when version 1.2.1 was released? Was it yesterday? Last year? Ten years ago?</li>
<li>What is your company/team's meaning behind a major, minor, and patch increment?</li>
<li>Who decides when a new major version is released? Is it a person? Maybe it's based on the size of an architectural change?</li>
<li>What happens to the version where the manager or developer forgot to put together a change log?</li>
</ul>
<p>Every developer I've come across so far knows about Semantic Versioning, but rarely do they have insight into the process at their companies. When I ask about the changes between version 1.2.1 and 1.2.3, I see them launch off on a new crusade, looking for their change logs.</p>
<p>This has been going on for years, and I think it's time for a new solution.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, I have been implementing what some might consider heresy, but I see it as the future of versioning.</p>
<h2>Introducing, GitDate Versioning</h2>
<p>The formula is simple:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code>year.month.day.git-short-code</code></pre>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>2021.03.22.d31d336</li>
<li>2021.03.31.44cf59b1</li>
<li>2021.03.31.21df22d1</li>
<li>2021.05.25.5a2ac478</li>
<li>2022.02.14.2c52a964</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can tell the date the version was created.</li>
<li>You can look up changes quickly by using git compare.</li>
<li>Your infrastructure team gained visibility into when the software was last released.</li>
<li>If the release process doesn't create a git tag, you can still clone a copy of the code for a specific version.</li>
<li>The format can easily be extended.</li>
<li>Customers now have visibility into the last time their software was updated.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Possible Cons:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Multiple builds on the same day? You would need access to the git repo to figure out which came first.</li>
<li>Customers now have visibility into the last time their software was updated.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an opinion or suggestion, please leave it in the comments below.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
