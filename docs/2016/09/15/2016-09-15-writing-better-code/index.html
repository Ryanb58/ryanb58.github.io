        <h2>Writing Better Code</h2>
        <div class="post-body">
            <p>As a software engineer/artist I could spend copious amounts of time refactoring. <br />
However, at some point products have to be shipped. You can't just keep<br />
 pushing deadlines back further and further. Instead I utilize the tips below<br />
 to provide functional code that is also clean.</p>
<h2>The DRY Principle.</h2>
<p>DRY stands for "don't repeat yourself" and you shouldn't. If you do, STOP! <br />
Repeating yourself will never be a good practice. <br />
The programming gods invented functions for a reason. Start now by splitting up<br />
your big <code>main()</code> function.</p>
<h2>Design Patterns</h2>
<p>What you might not of know is that there are three major categories of<br />
design patterns; creational, structural, and behavioral. Each category having a<br />
plethora of tools to help solve everyday software problems. </p>
<h2>Understand The Computer</h2>
<p>Knowing that the windows registry exists and how to edit it is not "understanding"<br />
the inner workings of a computer. Understanding a computer means having knowledge <br />
about things such as the data path on the CPU and different levels of cache.</p>
<p>If you don't understand how a CPU does computations such <br />
as multiplication down at a binary level, how are you suppose to think in terms<br />
of performance? When your application is eating up precious cycles for useless <br />
tasks, being able to optimize the program and utilizing your compilers internals<br />
to elevate things to a kernel level commands can become of utmost importance.</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>This one is really just based on how much experience a person has with the utilities<br />
of their trade. Currently I use VS Code + a Vim Shortcut plugins. I then utilize<br />
flake8 to keep my code style up to par and PyLint to ensure no bugs exist in my<br />
code.</p>
<p>I'm not saying switch to my tools, I'm saying start diving deep into how they work. <br />
Ask yourself, are there any menu's or options you haven't explored before? Mess<br />
around with them until you figure out. Can you use a tool in a way it wasn't meant to?<br />
Try it. Don't settle, expand it and put it into your pipeline.</p>
<h2>Readability</h2>
<p>This one is very important. Instead of writing a list comprehension that goes way past <br />
the end of the 79 character PEP8 line length, use multiple lines. Name variables<br />
appropriately and keep packages clean. All things that you should be actively striving for<br />
when writing code or refactoring.</p>
<h2>Code Reviews</h2>
<p>Open source or not you should strive to get someone to review your code. This helps<br />
promote a more open environment and prevents bugs from making it into production code.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>I could talk for hours on this one. Testing is essential. <br />
Start out with unit tests and verify small components of the system. Once<br />
you get a hold of how to do that, start adding integration tests for business <br />
essential parts of your application.</p>
<p>Have a ton of services? Test the main functionality of these programs by running<br />
smoke tests. Smoke tests are very light weight scripts that verify the conditions<br />
of your system. A good example of smoke tests is ensuring your FTP server is <br />
online and that the user can login.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wrapping things up, you should always strive for clean and readable code. I hope<br />
that some of the items I've listed above can enable you and your team to create<br />
 amazing and beautiful products for people all over the world.</p>
<p>Please feel free to share this post and comment anything I left out or might be<br />
able to improve on for my own sake.</p>
