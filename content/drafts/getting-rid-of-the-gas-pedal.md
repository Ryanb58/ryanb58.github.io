Title: We can save 10,000 people a year in the US by replacing the gas pedal.

With a strong thesis like the one above, you'd think that there would be some politician or activist out there advocating for the replacement of the gas pedal. But i looked, and there isn't. In fact, all anyone is talking about is Tesla and it's full self driving. Not a bad thing to be talking about, but certainly not something we have a full solution too, right now.

#### The Why? 

When I forget to eat, I get hangry. Hangry is an emotion defined as being bad-tempered or irritable as a result of hunger. I navigate to my fridge and discover I also forgot to go grocery shopping. The obvious solution is for me to hop into my car and navigate the short path to my local Taco Bell. This senario is all to common amongst the US, primarily because residential areas are so far away from commercial real estate.
