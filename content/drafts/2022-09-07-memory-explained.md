Computer are built with two cateogories of memory in mind. Persistent and Non-Persistent memory.

Persistent Memory - This is data that can live between power cycles. If the computer if turned off, it can be brought back online and it's data retrieved using this type of storage.

Non-Persistent Memory - Data living in this type of memory should be classified as ephemeral. If the computer is power cycles, all data is lost.




When personal computing first started to get popular, harddrives were made of physical spinning disks.

Another word for a harddrive with a spinning disk is called a `Platter Drive`. This is much more specific as harddrive is still used to this day to reference different types of modern storage devices.

At a high level a platter drive consists of a single platter, spindle, head, actuator arm, actuator, data port, jumper port, and a power port.

These spinning platters allowed data to persist between power cycles thus can be refered to as persistent storage.

The way data is stored on these disks are in chunks.

Reading data chunk by chunk takes time. The physical component causes us to wait for the actualtor arm to move between each chunk and read it into memory(RAM). Then, once assembled, that data be manipulated and transfromed and sent back to the harddrive for persistent storage.
