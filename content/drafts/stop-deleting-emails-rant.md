Stop deleting your emails. The concept of the zero inbox is dumb and inappropriate for this day and age. If I ask you about something, and you don't remember, so you rummage through your inbox to find it.. only to discover you deleted the email where the details were defined. I will be furious. Space is basically unlimited now days, and you should take advantage of it by not deleting any worthwhile emails. 

Given there are limits. I'd recommend deleting the spam email you get from every marketing agency out there.. sure. But emails from friends, family, coworkers, customers, etc.. should be left in your inbox to rot. Do it. Search is an amazing feature and it will help you find that email on the worst possible day. Keep it around friend!
