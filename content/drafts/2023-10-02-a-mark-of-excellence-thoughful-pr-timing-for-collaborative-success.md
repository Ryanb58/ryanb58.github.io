**Adjusting to the Realities of Big Tech Workflow**

Upon joining big tech, I've observed a recurring pattern across various divisions. Engineers often submit their PR (Pull Request) just before announcing their OOF (Out of Office). Such last-minute rushes have resulted in additional stress for on-call engineers, disrupted vacations, and even piled-on stress for the returning engineer.

A simple solution exists: aim to merge your PR 2 to 3 weeks before any planned break. This allows ample time for the team to review, verify changes, and gather customer feedback. A common misconception among some engineers is that once a PR is merged, their job is over. In reality, a software engineer's role isn’t complete until the end-user can successfully use the feature. Sidestepping this responsibility is short-sighted.

Consider the potential outcomes:

1. The PR is merged and goes live. Customers, eager to use the new or updated feature, are instead met with additional issues. They reach out to on-call engineers, who then scramble to understand the problem, perhaps applying a temporary solution, creating a hot fix, or even reverting the changes.
 
2. In some instances, the on-call engineer might be unable to rectify or roll back the change. This necessitates reaching out to the engineer responsible for the feature – potentially intruding on their time off.

3. Another all-too-common scenario is the change being reverted during the original engineer's vacation. Upon return, this engineer is surprised and, in some cases, may react negatively towards well-intentioned colleagues who were caught off-guard by the initial change.

**In Summary**:

When planning your next project, be it a new feature or a bug fix, consider merging it a few weeks before any scheduled leave. By doing so, you'll ensure a seamless experience for your customers and foster a more cohesive team environment.
