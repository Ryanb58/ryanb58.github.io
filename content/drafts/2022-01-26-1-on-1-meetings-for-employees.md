A question I often get from incoming/junior engineers is what should I talk about in my 1:1 meetings. The more I speak to this the more the outline below starts to appear in my mind. Perhaps it'll help you plan your next 1:1 meeting.

Problems - Issues you've had this last week.
 - Sam and I aren't getting along. What can I do to improve our relationship?
 - Jenny did a really good job on her presentation but I think she left out this key detail. I believe this might be caused by the amount of stress on her over the past quarter.
 - I am struggling with our new log system. Can you pair me up with someone to guide me through some of the basics?

Praise - Give your coworkers praise.
 - Kyle did an outstanding job working with that one customer.
 - Jenny has been on it this whole week.
 - Thank you for your suggestion on that issue I had this past week. It allowed me to complete my ticket on time and made this large set of customers happy.


Suggestions - Give your manager feedback.
 - The way you handled this specific situation felt off. You might want to address the team about it at some point.
 - I think we are focusing on the wrong metric, perhaps this other KPI should be considered as a bit higher of priority.

Promotions
 - What does my next promotion look like and what are those job responsibilities.
 - Am I acting as if I am already in that role? What can I do better to conform to those
