A few months ago my team switched from Slack to Microsoft Teams. While most things work as expected, one that comes off a bit clunky is pasting text. Here are a few shortcuts to help make life more comfortable.

Paste and Match Style on Mac + Slack: **CMD + SHIFT + v**

Paste and Match Style on Mac + Teams: **CMD + SHIFT + OPTION + v**

If you'd like to use the old shortcut in teams you can perform the following steps:

1. Open System Preferences
2. Navigate to `Keyboard`
3. Select Shortcuts tab
4. Select App Shortcuts from the left side
5. Click '+'
6. Select "Microsoft Teams" as the Application
7. Enter "Paste and Match Style" as menu item
8. Set `cmd-shift-v` as shortcut

Enjoy!
