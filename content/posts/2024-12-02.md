I'm back to self hosting a few services across Digital Ocean & Hetzner.

Previously, I self-hosted on a local Synology box, but it was underpowered and exposed my home internet IP to the world.

However, a few months back, I came across a tool called [Coolify](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/).

At first, I was just looking for a way to self-host some docker services outside of my AWS account.

However, going down this rabit hole, lead me to hosting a lot more servies than I original expected.

Now I am hosting the following across multiple cloud VMs.

- [ConvertX](https://github.com/C4illin/ConvertX/)
- [Horder](https://github.com/hoarder-app/hoarder)
- [Listmonk](https://github.com/knadh/listmonk)
- [ERP Jobs](https://erpjobs.io)
- [Cheaper Abroad](https://cheaperabroad.io)
- And so much more.

I’m happy to make this move, as I’ve been feeling a bit tired and my time has become more limited while advancing into my 30s and as my career continues to progress positively.

By using Coolify, I gain privacy advantages, and self-hosting provides greater control.
