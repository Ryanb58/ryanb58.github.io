Recently, I've noticed an uptick in the usage of the words **Revenue** and **Profit** in my vicinity. Whereas this isn't a bad thing, I think the meaning of each gets skewed in some conversations. Therefore, now seems like a good time to quickly review each of their definitions.

The word **Revenue** according to Merriam Webster's 2nd description is as follows. 

> the gross income returned by an investment

For example, if I sold 10 cattle for $500 each, that would leave me with a Revenue of $5000.

The word **Profit** according to Merriam Webster's 2nd description is as follows. 

> the excess of returns over expenditure in a transaction or series of transactions

If we append to the previous example and say that each cow cost me $100 each. Then we would deduct that cost from the **revenue** and end up with the **profit**. Therefore, $5000 - $1000 = A profit of $4000.

For a more detailed analysis on these two words, I encourage you to take a look at [Investopedia's article](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122214/what-difference-between-revenue-and-profit.asp) comparing the two.

Enjoy!
