Today I learned about uPnP.

I came across a blog post by [Kevin Norman](https://kn100.me/turning-upnp-off/) who talks about how his NAS punched its way through the local consumer router, exposing itself to the world. This sparked my attention, as how could it even do such a thing without human input? From what I remember with my time sitting in a networking class, you had to manually forward ports to allow a locally hosted website to be accessible from the public web. Ends up this isn't the case anymore with a technology called uPnP. 

uPnP stands for Universal Plug and Play. It is a set of networking protocols built on top of TCP/IP stack. According to uPnP-hacks.com it was created back in the 1990s by Microsoft as a competing protocol to Sun's JINI. The main reason for it's development was to allow networking devices to attach themselves to networks in comparison to how a hot swappable hard drive can be added to your NAS box. 

Some interesting use cases:

- Discover an xBox on the network.
- Allow your IP Webcam to be publicly accessible.
- Retrieve music and video from a media server.
- Allow smart home appliances to discover each other and share info.
- Enable syncing of local IoT devices

While going down this rabbit hole of discovery I came across one of my own favorite project uses uPnP for local discovery. WLED.
