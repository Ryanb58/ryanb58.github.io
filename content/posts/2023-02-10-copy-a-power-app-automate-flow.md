### Working in a Solution?

Currently it seems that making a copy of a flow does not automatically place it into the solution your source flow was in. Thus you will probably have to add it manually.

You can do this by opening up the solution explorer(Home>Solutions) and using the context menu to add the flow to your existing solution.
