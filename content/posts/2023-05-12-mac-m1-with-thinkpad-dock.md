At work, I've been procrastinating on figuring out how to connect my Macbook to the Dell monitors my workplace provides. Sure, having two large 27" displays would help me out, but would it really increase productivity? Well, as long as I'm getting my work done and helping others do more with less, who really cares, right?

So, today, I figured it out. Ends up I needed some "Drivers". I am curious to why I need them, but for now, it works. And thus progress has been made, and I can save the real detective work of the true underlying reason for future me.

Once you have the software installed, you'll be able to use the dock in all it's glory.

Enjoy!
