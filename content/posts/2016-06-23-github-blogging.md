Hello internet!

I'm just going to get straight to the point, I use to have a personal/tech blog @ [tech-fyi.net](http://tech-fyi.net) but like bread, it got stale. I started it over 7 years ago when I was in high school. Since then, I have graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Purdue and have moved on to more interesting things in life. 

More soon. Don't forget to interact with me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/Ryanb58)!
