Emoji's and GIFs are essential for people trying to express their emotions & feelings over chat. Doing so allows them to build happier relationships and reduce anxiety amongst team members.

So why in the world does Microsoft Teams show a `Sent a GIF` link instead of embedding the GIF in the chat window?

I don't know... but it's really annoying, and I finally discovered a way to get these GIFs to show up properly.

1. Make sure this setting is **unchecked**!
	1. Settings > General > Display > Turn off animations (requires restarting Teams)
2. And make sure this setting is **checked**.
	1. Settings > Privacy > Optional connected experiences
3. Restart Teams.

Enjoy!
