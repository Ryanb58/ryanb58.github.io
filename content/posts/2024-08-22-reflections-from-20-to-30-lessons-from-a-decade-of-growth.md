### My Journey in a Nutshell:

### False Beliefs I Once Held:
- You should have everything figured out.
- Success follows a linear path.
- You’ll stop making mistakes eventually.
- Money solves all problems.
- Confidence comes from having all the answers.
- “Fake it till you make it” is a reliable strategy.
- Saying “No” is bad and can close doors.

### Things I Learned Along the Way:
- Big software rewrites are usually a waste of energy, time, and money.
- Solving business problems should take priority over pursuing technical perfection.
- Being nice costs nothing and often pays off in unexpected ways.
- Helping others achieve their goals can be just as rewarding as fulfilling your own.
- Rules are often created without foresight; following them blindly is a mistake.
- Software isn’t always the solution, but it can be a powerful tool.
- Ideas are plentiful; the ones who execute them are rare.
- Perfection is the enemy of progress.
- Quality beats quantity. IMHO.
- Learn to say “Yes” to opportunities that push you out of your comfort zone.
- Traveling the world isn’t as scary as it seems — it’s incredibly fun.
- Enjoy the Journey because the destination isn't always that interesting.
- Take care of your teeth.
- Spend time thinking about your career, not just what you need to accomplish today.
- Life style changes are more important than diets when trying to loose or gain weight.
- Best part(code) is no part(code).
- Setting ambitious goals is a good idea.

- Physical work is a great type of therapy.
- Craft and tell good stories.
- A rising tide lifts all boats.

Buh-bye to my Twenties, and Hello to my Thirties!
