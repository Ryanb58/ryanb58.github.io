​​Today, I will share one of my failures that pushed me to grow as a professional.

A long time ago, I was approached by a company to help out with some freelancing. The work was trivial but rewarding as the cause was noble. 

As I performed the tasks asked of me, I noticed that they used a platform that felt like it was right out of the 90s. This platform was built using inflexible technologies, and you could feel how the product's company had forced a round peg into a square hole. This prompted me to evaluate the product and think about recreating it on my own.

The gist of the product was to provide both a public facing website and a backend for data. The data would be inputted by a person at a call center or via a form on the website, then followed up on by a specialist. That specialist would then select a resource from a carefully crafted resource list to provide to the caller. They would then document the interaction and move on to the next.

I felt the weight of the clunky website builder, the lack of cohesion across the product, and the high learning curve it took to perform even the simplest of tasks. These are the things that inspired me to think about rebuilding it. 

Like all good engineers, you first need to write out the requirements. So, I alone, took it upon myself to write the following three lines:

 - Provide a way to collect dynamic data from users.
 - Account management with the ability to create very specific roles for call center employees.
 - A resource management database.

From that list, I began to build my version of the product. I bought a domain, created a private GitHub repo, and started working towards what I thought was going to be my first successful SaaS. 

I spend the next 6 months of working weekends and evenings and finally got to a point where I wanted to show off what I had created. So I spent some time reaching out to the people who had hired me for the contracting job and started going through user flows. What I learned next has changed me forever. 

Immediately following my first demonstration, I was asked about features I had not considered. It went from one feature, to another feature, to a list of features. All things I didn't even know the existing product could perform. Below are a few examples that I was asked for.

 - Ability to text back each person that contacted them.
 - Integration with a specific taxonomy data structure.
 - Ability to back up all data.
 - Send automated emails to partners asking them to update their resource's data.
 - Collect data from custom surveys displayed on their site.
 - Create custom fields that could then be used in the forms for collection.

In the end, my lack of experience gathering requirements, failure to iterate quickly, and lack of focus led me down the wrong path. And as expected, my motivation waned, and I ended up scratching the project. 

Because I had worked so much on my ideal version of the product, I had missed the purpose of what I was attempting to do. Trying to help make the workers lives easier and less cumbersome. The extra "required" features felt overwhelming at the time, and I ended up moving on to other endeavors.
