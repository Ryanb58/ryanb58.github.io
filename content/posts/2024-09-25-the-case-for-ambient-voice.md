It’s funny how small things can make such a big difference.

Discord, for instance, nailed it with passive voice chats.

Not just a tweak, but something that changes the way people work together.

It’s not a new feature, but they’ve managed to perfect the idea, turning voice channels into open rooms—always on, always available, but without any obligation to speak.

It’s surprising that Microsoft Teams hasn’t caught on to this yet. You’d think a sharp product manager would have jumped at the chance to add a similar feature, especially with all the talk about improving remote collaboration. But, here we are, still waiting.

In the meantime, I came up with a stopgap solution for my own team. Every Tuesday and Thursday, I schedule a recurring calendar event called “Team Voice Chat.” It’s just a simple placeholder:

```toml
Event Name: Team Voice Chat
Show As: Free
Require Responses: No
```

I add the team as optional attendees. The idea is that it’s there if you want it, and you’re free to drop in or out as needed. It worked well during a recent hackathon, and now we’re testing it over a longer stretch.

And it’s paying off. The benefits are exactly what you’d expect:

- Collaboration gets a boost because you’re not scheduling every conversation.
- Team bonding happens naturally in those small, unplanned moments.
- Productivity goes up, because feedback is immediate.
- It’s flexible, convenient, and doesn’t break your flow.

So while we wait for Teams to catch up, this little hack has made our days a bit more frictionless. Simple, but effective—like most good ideas.
