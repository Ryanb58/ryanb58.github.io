Welcome to my creative portfolio, featuring an array of projects I've developed or am in the process of building. Here, you'll find a diverse range of concepts and creations that I've endeavored to turn into reality. Although I often embark on these journeys independently, sometimes I'm fortunate to team up with fellow enthusiasts who share my passion for an idea.

### Active:

[Track Your STR](https://trackyourstr.com):

 - Assist users in tracking material participation hours for Short-Term Rental (STR) properties, a requirement by the IRS to achieve real estate professional status.
 - This tracking allows users to categorize their rental income as active, enabling deductions from their regular income for tax purposes.

### Retired:

Spare Cloud(https://sparecloud.io):

 - A cloud storage backup service.
 - Shutdown because of the lack of audience interest in the idea.

Tiny Tenant(https://tinytenant.io):

 - Airbnb automated responses system using Natural Language Processing.
 - Shutdown because Airbnb locked down their API.

Site Pixel(https://sitepixel.io):

 - A widget you can copy & paste the code of into your website that helps you gather feedback from your customers.
 - Initial version had only five smiley faces. A more approachable version of an NPS tool.
 - Someone reached out to buy it from me before I got my first customer. I denied their offer.
 - Shutdown after spending another wasted year of my life on it only for the passion to dwindle.

Job Board:

 - During the pandemic the rise of job boards was growing, so I decided to make my own.
 - Shutdown due to lack of time & increased competition.

My Disney Plan

 - Website used by families to generate Disney vacation itineraries.
 - Shutdown because I kept changing the technology behind the product instead of focusing on customer acquisition.

IR Hub

 - Information and Referral Hub
 - Shutdown because I overcomplicated the product and couldn't clearly define the MVP.

If You Catch My Drift

 - My first foray into affiliate marketing.
 - Randomly display one amazon affiliate product per day.
 - Shutdown because it didn't get any click through purchases in the first 90 days.

Armored Kicks

 - Drop shipping website selling silicon covers for shoes.
 - Shutdown because it was a lame product.

Boxed Freight:

 - My attempt at a company focused on doing the heavy lifting of care packages to college students.
 - Shutdown because no one was willing to pay. Most people said it was too expensive.

MLIA

 - I built a My Life Is Average Windows Phone 7 App for a class.
 - Shutdown because Microsoft killed off Windows Phone.
