Hello, I'm Taylor.

I carry around a tiny orange notebook where I write down most of my ideas.

**Current Life Goals:**
 - Document more day-to-day Problems/Solutions
 - Work towards building more useful tools
 - Start my own SAAS
 - Improve my Communication

I would also like to own one of those really tall sky scrapers one day, but that's a totally different story. 

**My Struggles:**
 - Idea Execution
 - Procrastination
 - Making time for my side projects

At work, building things feels easy. It's when I begin working on my own ideas at home that I tend to fade. Therefore, I am going to attempt this `build in public` mentality that seems to be sweeping the internet.
