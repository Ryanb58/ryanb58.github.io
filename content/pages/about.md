Hi there! I'm Taylor, and this is my little corner of the internet.

I am passionate about building easy-to-use and reliable web applications.

I've built low-level file systems, web apps to help people manage communities, mobile apps, and mostly enjoy working on backend code using python. Recently I've found myself playing around with these new AI models and just in general love it when people's lives are improved from my work.

Other than work, I enjoy traveling, reading, and coffee.
