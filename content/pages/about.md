Hello, I'm Taylor.

I carry around a tiny orange notebook where I write down ideas.

I am passionate about building easy-to-use and reliable web applications. 

My day-to-day includes communication between team members, requirement gathering from stakeholders, architecting new systems, writing and scaling code across multiple cloud infrastructures, and ensuring everyone around me has the resources they need. That last one is probably the most important; as the saying goes: "a rising tide lifts all boats."

Other than work, I enjoy the outdoors, reading, and coffee.

**Current Goals:**
 - Document more day-to-day Problems/Solutions
 - Work towards building more useful tools
 - Start my own SAAS

At work, building things feels easy. It's when I begin working on my own ideas at home that I tend to fade. Therefore, I am want to attempt this `build in public` mentality that seems to be sweeping the internet.
