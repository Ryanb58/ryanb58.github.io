Hello, I'm Taylor.

I am passionate about building easy-to-use and reliable web applications. 

My day-to-day tasks include communication between team members, requirement gathering from stakeholders, architecting new systems, writing, and scaling code across multiple cloud infrastructures, and ensuring everyone around me has the resources they need. That last one is the most important; as the saying goes: "a rising tide lifts all boats."

Other than work, I enjoy traveling, reading, and coffee.

**Current Goals: **
 - Document more day-to-day Problems/Solutions
 - Work towards building more useful tools
 - Start my own SAAS

At work, building things feels easy. It's when I begin working on my own ideas at home that I tend to fade. Therefore, I want to attempt this `build in public` mentality that seems to be sweeping the internet.
