Hi! I'm Taylor. Welcome to my small corner of the internet.

I am passionate about building web applications.

I've worked on low-level file systems, web apps to help people manage communities, mobile apps, and mostly enjoy working on backend code using python. Recently I've found myself working with new AI models.

Other than work, I enjoy traveling, reading, movies, and coffee.
