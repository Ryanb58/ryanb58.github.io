Hello, I'm Taylor. Just another Software Engineer and Entrepreneur floating around the web.

Day to day, I carry around a tiny orange notebook where I write down loads of ideas. From products, to shower thoughts; I am always trying to push my creative thinking.

I tend to ask a ton of questions which then leads me down rabbitholes on Youtube and Reddit. Most of the time, focused on a topic that is totally unrelated to my own life. For example: I do not need to do any actual home maintance because I live in an apartment, however, if you asked me to replace a sink, put up a LED strip, or attach a bidet; I would figure it out.

On my own I struggle with `idea execution`. Building things is easy at work. Surrounded by my peers, bouncing ideas off one another, discussing the next steps and business requirements. Simple. However, when I start to working on my own ideas I tend to fade. Thus, I am trying to build more things publicily to hold myself accountable.
