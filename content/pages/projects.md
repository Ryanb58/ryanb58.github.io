Welcome to my projects page! Here is a list of the things I've tried during my days. These mostly just cover my personal endevours but every now and then I find a partner willing to dive head first into some crazy idea.

### Current:

[Spare Cloud](https://sparecloud.io)

 - A cloud backup service.

### GraveYard:

Tiny Tenant:

 - AirBNB automated responses system using Natural Language Processing.
 - Shutdown because AirBNB's locked down their APIs.

Site Pixel:

 - A widget you can copy & paste the code of into your website that helps you gather feedback from your customers.
 - Initial version was only 5 smiley faces. Basically a more approachable version of a NPS tool.
 - Someone reached out to buy it from me before I got my first customer. I denied their offer.
 - Shutdown after spending another wasted year of my life on it only for the passion to dwindle.

Job Board:

 - During the pandemic the rise of job boards was growing, so I decided to make my own.
 - Shutdown due to lack of time & increased competiton.

My Disney Plan

 - Website used by families to generate Disney vacation itineraries.
 - Shutdown because I kept changing the technology behind the product instead of focusing on customer acquisition.

IR Hub

 - Information and Referral Hub
 - Shutodwn because I overcomplicated the product and couldn't clearly define the MVP.

If You Catch My Drift

 - My first foray into affiliate marketing.
 - Randomly displayed one amazon affiliate product per day.
 - Shutdown because because it didn't get any click through purchases in the first 90 days.

Armored Kicks

 - Dropshipping website selling silicon covers for shoes.
 - Shutdown because it was a lame product.

Boxed Freight:

 - My attempt at a company focused on doing the heavy lifting of care packages to college students.
 - Shutdown becasue no one was willing to pay. Most people said it was too expensive.

MLIA

 - I build a My Life Is Average Windows Phone 7 App for a class.
 - Shutdown because Microsoft killed off Windows Phone.
